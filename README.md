# Plant Disease Detection using CNN

This repository contains an implementation of plant disease detection using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built from scratch. The repository also contains a web app allowing users to upload an image of a plant and the CNN model predicts whether the plant is healthy or if it is affected by powdery mildew or rust.

## Introduction

Plant diseases can have a detrimental impact on crop yield. Early detection and intervention are crucial to prevent the spread of diseases and minimize damage. The Streamlit web application provides an easy-to-use interface for users to upload plant images, which are then processed using a CNN model to predict the health status of the plant.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Streamlit
- Numpy
- Pillow (PIL)
- The model weights file (`plant_disease_classifier.h5`) should be available in the `weights` directory.

You can install the required packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install tensorflow streamlit numpy pillow
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arpy8/Plant_Disease_Detection.git
   cd Plant_Disease_Detection_using_CNN
   ```

2. Place the model weights file (`plant_disease_classifier.h5`) in the `weights` directory.

3. Run the Streamlit app:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. The web app will open in your default web browser, allowing you to upload plant images for disease classification.

```

## Model

The model used for plant disease classification is a CNN model. It has been trained to classify plants into one of the following categories:
- Healthy
- Powdery
- Rust

The model's architecture and weights are loaded from the `plant_disease_classifier.h5` file.
